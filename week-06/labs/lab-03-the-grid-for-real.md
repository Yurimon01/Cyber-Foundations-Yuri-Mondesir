## Overview

In Week 5 you ran `ip addr`, `ip route`, `ping`, and `traceroute` in a simulator that always behaved. Today you run the same toolkit against real cloud infrastructure that does **not** always behave the way the textbook implies — and you learn to tell "broken" apart from "normal."

This is an **independent** lab. It tells you what to accomplish; you choose the commands. Expect about 40 minutes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Cloud Heights — live Ubuntu 22.04 VM, reached through Azure Bastion |
| Commands used | `ip addr`, `ip route`, `ping`, `traceroute`, `curl` |
| Known-good target | **Grid Beacon — `10.60.6.4`** |
| Prerequisite | Week 6 Labs 01–02 |

## Part A — Where You Actually Are

### Step 1 — Read Your Own Address

Run the command that lists your interfaces and addresses.

Command and output:

```
ip addr 

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group def
ault qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group d
efault qlen 1000
    link/ether 60:45:bd:4b:c0:b8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.60.6.30/26 metric 100 brd 10.60.6.63 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::6245:bdff:fe4b:c0b8/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: enP62367s1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq mast
er eth0 state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 60:45:bd:4b:c0:b8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enP62367p0s2
```

Your private IPv4 address and prefix length:

```
10.60.6.30 and the prefix length is 26
```

### Step 2 — Read Your Route

Run the command that shows the routing table.

Command and output:

```
command - ip route

default via 10.60.6.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 10.60.6.30 metric 100 
10.60.6.0/26 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.60.6.30 metric 100 
10.60.6.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp scope link src 10.60.6.30 metric 100 
168.63.129.16 via 10.60.6.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 10.60.6.30 metric 100 
169.254.169.254 via 10.60.6.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 10.60.6.30 metric 100 
```

Your default gateway:

```
10.60.6.1
```

### Step 3 — Compare to Week 5

Compare this live Ubuntu output to what the CLI Simulator produced in Week 5. What looks the same, what looks different, and what surprised you:

```
As I went back into Week 5's simulator I for one can see that there is way less data shown in the CLI simulator. In the ubuntu workstation I see nearly 15 iterations of what looks like an IP address. The similarities are found in the fact that both gateway address are typed after the term <default via>
```

---

## Part B — The Gateway That Does Not Answer

### Step 1 — Ping the Gateway

Ping the default gateway address you recorded. Let it run a few seconds, then stop it.

Command and output:

```
ping 10.60.6.1

--- 10.60.6.1 ping statistics ---
603 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 616436ms
```

### Step 2 — Interpret It Correctly

You almost certainly got **no replies**. In Azure, the platform gateway commonly does not answer ICMP. This is **expected platform behaviour** and by itself proves nothing about whether your machine or network is broken.

Explain why "the gateway did not answer ping" is weak evidence:

```
The gateway not pinging is weak evidence as it is not a feature that even occurs in Azure. And because that is not a feature you won't be able to know if the gateway is working based on whether it answers you back or not. So it is important to ping a server past the gateway and see if an answer is given back to know if the gateway is up and running.
```

---

## Part C — The Known-Good Target

The **Grid Beacon** at `10.60.6.4` is a machine that is known to be up and known to answer. When your first probe fails, you test against something known-good before you conclude anything.

### Step 1 — Ping the Beacon

```
ping 10.60.6.4
```
Output:

```
When I pinged it, I got nearly 200 lines of data that loaded in, I decided to hit ctrl-c to stop the data from rolling in.

64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=192 ttl=64 time=1.09 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=193 ttl=64 time=1.07 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=194 ttl=64 time=1.01 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=195 ttl=64 time=1.13 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=196 ttl=64 time=2.36 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=197 ttl=64 time=1.13 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=198 ttl=64 time=1.03 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=199 ttl=64 time=1.09 ms
64 bytes from 10.60.6.4: icmp_seq=200 ttl=64 time=1.05 ms
^C
--- 10.60.6.4 ping statistics ---
200 packets transmitted, 200 received, 0% packet loss, time 199252ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.944/1.169/3.504/0.290 ms
```

### Step 2 — Trace the Path

```
traceroute 10.60.6.4
```
Output:

```
traceroute to 10.60.6.4 (10.60.6.4), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  grid-beacon.internal.cloudapp.net (10.60.6.4)  1.457 ms  1.417 ms  1.440 
ms
```

### Step 3 — Ask the Application

```
curl http://10.60.6.4
```
Output:

```

> ### ⚠️ Grid Beacon not responding?
> The Grid Beacon is shared course infrastructure and should normally be available. First, confirm your Cloud Heights VM shows **Running** and that you completed the preceding network checks. Then retry the command once after a minute or two.
>
> If the Grid Beacon still does not respond, **stop this part of the lab and contact your instructor.** Record that the shared service was unavailable; do not treat the result as evidence that your VM or your work is incorrect.
>
> Do not change networking, NSGs, firewall rules, routes, DNS, or any Azure settings to try to reach the beacon.
>
> *Instructor note: a confirmed Grid Beacon outage is an environment issue, not a student error. Affected students may complete this portion of Lab 03 after the service is restored, with no penalty.*

### Step 4 — Record the Application Evidence

The beacon returns a banner and a trace ID. Record exactly what you received:

```
<h1>GRID BEACON</h1>

    <p><span class="label">NODE:</span> grid-beacon</p>
    <p><span class="label">NETWORK:</span> CVI Training Grid</p>
    <p><span class="label">STATUS:</span>
       <span class="status">ONLINE</span></p>

    <p>
        Network beacon established.<br>
        If you reached this node, your route is operational.
    </p>

    <div class="classified">
        <p>INVESTIGATION CHECKPOINT</p>

        <p>
            Observe the path that brought you here.
            The destination is only part of the story.
        </p>

        <p>TRACE ID: CF-NET-0604</p>
    </div>
```

Explain the difference between what the `ping` proved and what the `curl` proved:

```
The difference between what the ping and curl provide is based on straightforwardness. The ping of our grid-beacon showed us that it is able to receive packets. While the curl is giving you a clear answer to whether the node/server you inputted is online or not.
```

### Step 5 — Capture Your Evidence

Two screenshots, both cropped to the terminal only:

**Required filename:** `vm-toolkit-live.png` — your `ip addr` and `ip route` output

## Part D — Rewrite the Ladder Rule

Week 5 taught the Ladder Rule: test the near thing before the far thing. Real infrastructure adds a wrinkle — a silent rung is not automatically a broken rung.

Rewrite the Ladder Rule in your own words so that it survives real cloud infrastructure. Your version must include both **route/path evidence** and **a known-good target**:

```
So week 5 taught among the Ladder rule you must test the near thing before the far thing. However, once you test whether your machine is up and running you would want to test a far thing prior to testing your gateway. Because the gateway not responding does not mean that the gateway is down, instead pinging a known-good target can aid you to move forward in knowing that your machine is able to send packets down your gateway and unto another server.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Your ping to the gateway failed and your ping to the beacon succeeded. What does that pair of results, taken together, prove about your machine's networking? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
This proves that one my machine is working, because things are able to be sent. Its also showing me that the gateway is working as the packets were able to get out of neighborhood and into someone else's. So, the networking of my machine is up and running.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Why is `traceroute` useful even when `ping` already answered? What extra thing does it show you? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Traceroute route shows how many hops, which is good to know how many locations are being passed. Additionally, traceroute shows you the actual path the packets have taken. Thus, meaning that if there was an issue on hop 8 you would be able to see where the packets stopped and weren't able to continue traversing.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** A service is unreachable and ping to it succeeds. Where would you look next, and why is "the network is fine" an incomplete answer? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
If a service is unreachable and pinging to it succeeds, we might need to look deeper. We should look into its service, it's actual port. We know that packets can be sent but are we able to do anything with that service. This is where it might be wise to utilize a < 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Something already controls what is allowed to reach your machine in Cloud Heights. If you could decide those rules, what would you want to allow, what would you want to block, and who in an organization should get to make that decision? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
For one I think someone in the sorts of a chief information security analyst role would be the one to make those decisions. And I think something I would allow is for an analyst to have certain pre-disposed permissions. I don't think anyone outside of admins should have the ability to delete core files.
