## Overview

Lab 01 got you diagramming how hardware, OS, and software interact — in theory. This lab makes it real, in one sitting. First, you'll look up your own machine's actual specs (OS version, RAM, storage) using its built-in settings screens. Then you'll open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) and watch those same hardware and software layers working together live — CPU usage, memory usage, and real running processes — and connect what you see back to your Lab 01 diagram.

**No terminal or command line is required this week** — that starts in Week 3. Settings screens, Task Manager, and Activity Monitor are all point-and-click tools.

## Lab Environment

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Your own computer (Windows or Mac) — no VM, no cloud, no install needed |
| Required Materials | Your computer's built-in Settings/About screen; Task Manager (Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`) or Activity Monitor (Mac: `Cmd+Space`, then type "Activity Monitor") |

**Prerequisite:** Lab 01 completed — you'll reference your diagram in this lab's Analysis Questions.

## Part A — Find Your Real Specs

**Before you start:** here's what to expect so you don't second-guess yourself. On Windows, you're looking for a page titled **About**, reached via **Settings → System → About**, listing your device specs under "Device specifications." On Mac, you're looking for a window titled **About This Mac** (click the Apple menu, top-left corner), with an Overview tab listing your chip, memory, and macOS version. If what's on your screen doesn't roughly match that, you're in the wrong menu — try again before recording anything below.

### Step 1 — Find Your OS Version

Open your computer's system settings (Windows: **Settings → System → About**. Mac: **Apple menu → About This Mac**) and find the exact operating system name and version you're running.

**OS and version:** Windows 11 Version 25H2

```
(e.g., "Windows 11, version 23H2" or "macOS Sonoma 14.4")
```

### Step 2 — Check Your Installed RAM

On the same settings screen, find how much RAM (memory) is installed on your computer.

**Installed RAM:** 8.00GB

```
8.00GB
```

### Step 3 — Check Your Available Storage

Find your computer's total storage capacity and how much is currently free (Windows: **Settings → System → Storage**. Mac: **About This Mac → Storage**).

**Total storage:** 477GB

```
There is 213 GB if free storage.
```

**Free storage:** 213 GB

```
213GB
```

## Part B — Watch It Live

Your Part A numbers are a snapshot. This part shows those same layers actually working, moment to moment.

### Step 1 — Open Task Manager or Activity Monitor

Windows: press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`. Mac: press `Cmd+Space`, type "Activity Monitor," and press Enter.

### Step 2 — Find the Performance / CPU Tab

Windows: click the **Performance** tab. Mac: click the **CPU** tab.

### Step 3 — Freeze the List Before You Read It

The process list updates constantly and can be hard to read while it's jumping around. Before recording anything, click the **Name** column header (or **Memory**, if you'd rather sort by what's using the most RAM) to sort the list — this won't stop it from updating, but it keeps things from reordering under you while you read.

### Step 4 — Record CPU Usage

Look at the current CPU usage percentage.

```
Current CPU usage: ____%
```

### Step 5 — Record Memory Usage

Find how much RAM is currently in use, out of your total installed RAM (the same total you looked up in Part A).

```
RAM in use: ____   out of total: ____
```

### Step 6 — List Five Running Processes

List five processes running right now. For each, write your best guess at what it is or does — you don't need to be 100% correct, just reason it out. If you spot something on the cheat sheet below, you can use that, but try at least a couple you don't recognize.

**Cheat sheet — common processes you'll likely see (not exhaustive, just a starting reference):** Client Server Runtime Process ( I believe this assess runtime over applications that are coded on my computer) , Desktop Window Manager (this manages updates, Windows versions etc.) , Local Security Authority (I believe this is responsible for AnitViruses that are built unto my computer),  SmartyByte Network Service (I think this is a service  for my computer )  Waves Audio Service ( I believe this is what manages my input outputs of my speaker. )

| Process Name | Usually Seen On | What It Generally Is |
|---|---|---|
| explorer.exe | Windows | The Windows desktop and file browser itself — normal, always running |
| svchost.exe | Windows | A generic host for background Windows services — several running at once is normal |
| Antimalware Service Executable | Windows | Windows Defender scanning files in the background — normal |
| dwm.exe | Windows | Desktop Window Manager — handles visual effects like transparency and window animations |
| System Idle Process | Windows | Not a real program — represents how much CPU is doing *nothing* right now |
| WindowServer | Mac | Manages everything drawn on your screen — always running |
| Finder | Mac | The Mac desktop and file browser itself — normal, always running |
| mdworker / mds | Mac | Spotlight's background indexing service — normal, can spike briefly after installing apps |
| launchd | Mac | The very first process Mac starts — manages and launches other background services |

```
1. Process name: __________   What I think it does: __________
2. Process name: __________   What I think it does: __________
3. Process name: __________   What I think it does: __________
4. Process name: __________   What I think it does: __________
5. Process name: __________   What I think it does: __________
```

### Step 7 — Screenshot and Embed

Take a screenshot of Task Manager or Activity Monitor showing your CPU/memory usage and process list.

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-02/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, then drag in your screenshot, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces — e.g. `machine-exploration.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and paste that link into the embed line below, in place of the placeholder:

```markdown
![Task Manager / Activity Monitor screenshot](paste your copied image link here)
```

**If right-click doesn't show that option:** click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

### Step 8 — Connect the Numbers

In your own words, explain how the real numbers you found in Part A (OS version, RAM, storage) relate to what you just watched live in Part B. Which number describes hardware, and which describes the OS?

```
I would say the data in Part 2 gave light to what is under the hood < hardware wise >. While the information in Part B broke down the software layer. These two coincide as Part B is showing us what the part in the hardware layer are being used, how they're being used/affected by the software layer.
```

## Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1

Pick one process from your list in Part B, Step 6. Is it "software" in the sense Lab 01 used that word? Explain how it depends on the OS and on hardware to actually run.

```
Microsoft Edge is an application or program that runs instructions that are stored on my computer. It is software as it sits on the third layer of the process and relies on the OS in order to utilize the memory, CPU time and allocated access as needed. The OS acts as the manager, managing the resources that the application will need.
```

### Analysis Question 2

Your CPU usage number changes constantly, even when you're not doing anything. Explain, in your own words, why watching this number matters for security work — not just for performance. (Hint: think about what it might mean if a process you don't recognize suddenly spikes CPU usage.)

```
If a process I don't recognize suddenly spikes CPU usage it can be a hint that someone is utilizing memory, power and resources on your computer. Whether it's in the backend or the front end, looking at unusual trends in CPU performance can reveal if there is malicious activity occurring. Watching these numbers can possibly help a security analyst look into an issue before it becomes a more serious one.
```

### Analysis Question 3

Compare what you saw in Task Manager/Activity Monitor to the diagram you built in Lab 01. What's the same? What did watching your machine live show you that a static diagram couldn't?

```
The part that is similar in comparison is the fundamental properties found in the hardware layer. But the Task Manager dashboard gives a moving picture to what I drew. It showed me how much CPU and memory are being used at a given time and for different applications as well.
```
