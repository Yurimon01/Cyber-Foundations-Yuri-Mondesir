# Week 4 Lab — Build Your First Virtual Machine (VM Builder Simulator) ★ Deliverable 1

**Student Name:** Yuri Mondesir

**Date Completed:** 8/12/2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-03-vm-builder.md`

## Overview

Lessons 3 and 4 taught you what a virtual machine is and how one lives and dies. This capstone lab hands you the keys: in the VM Builder Simulator you'll provision a machine of your own through the full five-question wizard (Part A), handle whatever provisioning throws at you (Part B), and run the complete lifecycle — stop, start, snapshot, delete — while a billing meter runs (Part C). This lab is the heart of **★ Deliverable 1: VM concepts + CLI screenshots** — its two screenshots join the two from Labs 01 and 02 in your portfolio repo.

**The simulator will push back on purpose.** Taken names, refused passwords, quota limits, and a region that sometimes fails are all part of the exercise — reading an error calmly and fixing the right thing *is* the skill being graded. Errors here are progress, not mistakes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations VM Builder Simulator — runs entirely in your web browser; nothing to install, no account needed, no real servers, no real money |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 3 and 4 completed; Labs 01 and 02 recommended first |
| Concept Checks | The simulator gates progress on four Concept Checks — all four are covered in Lessons 3 and 4 |
| Time | Plan for 30–45 minutes, including this worksheet |

### How to Open the Simulator — Step by Step

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari all work — use a computer, not a phone, so your screenshots capture the full screen).
2. Go to this address (you can also click the **VM Builder Simulator** link on the Lab Portal's Week 4 page — same destination):

```
https://cybervisionariesinstitute.github.io/cyberfoundations-simulators/vm-builder.html
```

3. Confirm you're in the right place: you should see a dark purple header reading **"Foundry District Cloud Annex"** and a page titled **"Mission Briefing: Provision Your First Virtual Machine."** If you see anything else, re-check the address.
4. Read the Mission Briefing all the way down — especially the **"How to use this simulator"** box. It explains the six steps, the Concept Checks, and the two screenshot moments.
5. Get your screenshot tool ready before you begin: **Windows:** press `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** press `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You will need it twice, at moments the simulator announces with a 📸 banner.
6. Keep this worksheet open in a **second browser tab**, side by side with the simulator — you'll record answers as you go.

**⚠️ One thing to know before you start:** refreshing the simulator page **resets the entire simulation** — nothing is saved between visits. That's safe (it's a training environment), but capture each screenshot when prompted, before moving on, and don't refresh mid-run unless you want a fresh start.

**Also before you start:** have Lesson 4's Resource Pack open to its Quick Reference page (the lifecycle/billing table). You'll want it.

## Part A — Provision Your Machine

### Step 1 — Name It Like a Professional

Work through the Basics screen: choose a VM name that passes the naming rules *and* would tell a stranger what this machine is for. Note: at least one obvious name is already taken — if you hit **NameNotAvailable**, that's the simulator doing its job; pick another and record what happened.

The name you chose, and whether you hit the taken-name error first:

```
foundry-locket
```

### Step 2 — Choose a Region, and Say Why

Pick a region on the Basics screen. Each option describes a trade-off (latency, capacity). Record your choice and one sentence of reasoning — professionals never pick a region at random.

Your region and your reasoning:

```
I chose foundry central. In addition to it stating recommended, I chose it because I believe latency is a very important aspect when it comes to getting the bank for your buck. If you have a bunch of VM's that are running quite slowly, your company will be taking a hit in different areas.
```

### Step 3 — Choose Your Guest OS

Pick an operating system and record why. There's no wrong answer, but there is a *reasoned* answer — think about which shell you'd rather manage it with, and what the license fee note tells you.

Your OS choice and reasoning:

```
I chose Linux. Like I have stated in previous assessments, I think Linux has commands that are easier to remember and shorter terms, leaving less room for spelling errors.
```

### Step 4 — Size It, and Do the Money Math

Pick a size tier. Record its specs and hourly rate, then do Lesson 4's monthly reflex: hourly rate × 24 × 30. Would you leave this machine running for a month?

Your size tier, its specs, and its hourly rate:

```
I chose the D2s_v3. This tier has 
```

Your monthly math (rate × 24 × 30):

```
0.110 * 24 * 30 = 79.2
```

### Step 5 — Create the Admin Account

Create the administrator username and password. The simulator blocks guessable usernames and refuses weak passwords — if it pushes back, record what it rejected and what you learned from the rejection.

What (if anything) got rejected, and your final username (never record the password):

```
(type what was rejected and your final username here — do NOT write the password)
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED — Deliverable 1)

On the Review & Create screen — before you click Create — take the screenshot the simulator prompts for: your full configuration summary, including the total hourly cost. Name it exactly **`vm-config-summary.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part B — Survive Provisioning

### Step 1 — Create, and Read What Happens

Click **Create Virtual Machine** and watch the provisioning stages. Depending on your Part A choices, provisioning may fail with a readable error — **QuotaExceeded** (your size is bigger than the subscription allows) or **AllocationFailed** (your region ran out of capacity). If it fails: read the error, identify which wizard choice it points at, fix *that one thing*, and retry.

What happened on your first Create attempt (success, or the exact error name):

```
The first create attempt was a success.
```

If you hit an error: what it told you, and what you changed:

```
There was no error!
```

### Step 2 — Confirm You're Running

Once provisioning completes, confirm on the dashboard: status **Running**, and the billing meter ticking at the rate your size card promised. Record the rate the meter shows.

The running rate shown on your dashboard:

```
0.110/hr was the running rate I chose.
```

---

## Part C — Run the Full Lifecycle

Complete all four lifecycle tasks on the dashboard, in this order, and answer the simulator's Concept Checks as they appear.

### Step 1 — Stop, and Watch the Meter

Stop (deallocate) your VM. Watch what happens to the billing rate — it should not go to zero. Record the stopped rate and what it's paying for.

The stopped rate, and what a stopped VM still pays for:

```
The stoppe rate ended up being $0.002/hr. A stopped VM is not destroyed, the CPU and memory is on pause but you are still paying for disk space for your VM.
```

### Step 2 — Start It Again

Start the VM and confirm the full rate resumes. One sentence: where did your files go while it was stopped?

Your one-sentence answer:

```
My files were paused and remain on the disk as storage when the VM is stopped.
```

### Step 3 — Take a Snapshot

Take a snapshot and record its name from the snapshot list. One sentence: what exactly did you just photograph, and when would you be glad you have it?

Snapshot name and your one-sentence explanation:

```
[15:32:37] VM stopped (deallocated). Compute billing paused — disk storage still billing at $0.002/hr.

I would be glad to have a snapshot of this on hand for logging purposes. If you were on duty at a job and were the run responsible for stopping the VM for the night, this would be useful as proof that the job was done.
```

### Step 4 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED — Deliverable 1)

With your VM **Running** and at least one snapshot visible, take the dashboard screenshot. Name it exactly **`vm-dashboard-running.png`**.

### Step 5 — Delete, and Read the Warning

Delete your VM. Read the confirmation dialog before you click — record what it warns you is about to happen, then confirm and record your final total cost from the completion banner.

What the delete warning said, in your own words:

```
The delete warning explains that when it comes to VM, stopping the VM for the night is not the same as deleting it. One's files and data on this virtual machine will be permanently gone and unable to be recovered.
```

Your final simulated cost:

```
My final simulated cost was $12.88.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Your stopped VM kept billing a small amount. Explain the "locker fee" in your own words — what physical thing still exists when a VM is stopped, and why is deletion the only true zero? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The locker fee is the amount you pay to take up space on the disk. When the VM is stopped, you still have to be pay for your VM to exist somewhere, and you're getting charged because a service as such is being provided to you. Deletion is the only step in which a company would be paying "nothing" because nothing is being used nor serviced to you anymore.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Lesson 4 revealed that your real Weeks 6–12 lab machines are stamped from golden snapshots your instructor built. Using what you did in Part C, Step 3, explain how a golden snapshot works and why it means every student's machine starts identical. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A golden snapshot works as a template would work. You are getting the perfect template of how your VM is meant to look, function and be configured. And this means that every student's machine will be identical because every new VM is being created/copied from that original template.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** If you hit a provisioning error in Part B (or even if you didn't): why do you think this lab *wants* you to encounter errors in a simulator before Week 6 hands you real infrastructure? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
I think this lab wants you to encounter a provisioning error because it will give you a test of the real world. If you were responsible for utilizing the budget in a way that would allow the company, you work for to be able to do the work they need and do so efficiently, you need to think analytically. We need to be asking ourselves questions like "Does this provider provide low levels latency, is the price over our budget etc."
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Defend your Part A size choice to an imaginary manager watching the budget: why was your tier the right rent for this job, and what would have made you pick a bigger or smaller one? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
I believe the tier for size D2s_v# was the perfect fit for our job as it gives us what we need without going over budget. It lends itself low latency allowing for us to do our jobs without slow processing times.
```
